# Harbor

Harbor is an open-source container registry, originally developed by VMware and now under the CNCF umbrella. Although many of us typically use
hosted container registries such as DockerHub, Quay, ECR, GCR or ACR; when you need a self-hosted registry, Harbor is a great choice.
Harbor provides great features such as RBAC, replication and image scanning.

# Prometheus and exporters

Harbor doesnâ€™t expose Prometheus metrics natively (although there is an issue for it: #4557). However, Max Cai wrote a Prometheus exporter
that queries Harbor API and generates a bunch of useful metrics.

```
  helm install harbor harbor/harbor
```
