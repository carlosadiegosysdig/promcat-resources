# ElasticSearch
Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured,
and unstructured.

To get the metrics from elasticsearch and alert with prometheus server, you can use the [justwatchcom exporter](https://github.com/justwatchcom/elasticsearch_exporter),
with exporter we can gather the metrics from the elasticsearch api.
